# TrainScheduler

This Train Schedule project involved adding data to a Firebase database and displaying the data in a user-friendly way. The most challenging aspect of the project was calculating the time of next arrival and the minutes away with MomentJS. The solution involved going back over the documentation and previous projects to fully understand the problem, One important part of the solution is to subtract one year from the first departure, to ensure that the time is before the present moment so MomentJS could work with it.
